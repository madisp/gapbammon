\textbf{Background}

John and Miles are long-time friends and want to play backgammon together. Unfortunately they both live in different parts of the city and have access to a teletype terminal. So, they turn to GapBammon...

\begin{enumerate}[I]
\item John and Miles start a game of CLI backgammon by running a command in a terminal. John inputs his name first and becomes player1, Miles is upset because he is forced to be player2. Miles enters his name.
	
GapBammon rolls the dice for both players, John rolls a 6, Miles rolls a measly 2. This means that John is better again and gets to go first.
