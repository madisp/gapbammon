\textbf{Background}

John and Miles are long-time friends and want to play backgammon together. Unfortunately they both live in different parts of the city and have access to a teletype terminal. So, they turn to GapBammon...

\begin{enumerate}[I]
\item John and Miles start a game of CLI backgammon by running a command in a terminal. John inputs his name first and becomes player1, Miles is upset because he is forced to be player2. Miles enters his name.
	
GapBammon rolls the dice for both players, John rolls a 6, Miles rolls a measly 2. This means that John is better again and gets to go first.

\newpage
\item Miles and John have started the game. John needs to make a move against Miles. A backgammon board is displayed on the terminal screen (ASCII art). The game rolls dice for John with the outcome of 4 and 6. Now John can see a list of all available moves and select two of them consecutively to finish his turn. And so he does. The board is printed again to reflect the new game state.

\item 30 minutes of unearthly action follow. Suddenly, Miles is ahead and needs to make a final move. All but one of his stones have found their way into the basket. The game rolls doubles (two sixes) for Miles, which he easily turns into a win. The game ends and declares Miles the victor. 
John ragequits.

\section{Minutes from Meeting with Customer}

\hspace{1.5em}Customer: I have a couple of suggestions that could really improve GapBammon.\\
Firstly, there currently is no match system for keeping track of how many points a given player has gathered.
This brings us to another possible feature there is no doubling cube, which is a standard component of backgammon.
Additionally, we managed to find some bugs. Namely, the game ended up in an infinite loop.
   
The customer also pointed out some possible improvements to the user interface. The visual board could be improved to show stones that have been put on the bar and stones that have reached the basket. At the moment, users have to keep track by reading this information from lines below the board. 

Furthermore, the board is really basic and no way to easily differentiate between quadrants. This should definitely be fixed.
